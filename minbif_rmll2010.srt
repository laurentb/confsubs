1
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,149
I will do a quick presentation of Minbif

2
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,750
which allows you to use IRC to communicate with the real world, the modern world.

3
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,549
I don't know if there are many who know IRC, or don't know IRC maybe?

4
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,170
Considering the idleness of the room, I will… (shit)

5
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,500
I will (shit) be fairly short.

6
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,070
IRC is an ancient protocol which (fuck) was created in 88,

7
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,930
which… (so, something is advancing automatically… now that's better)

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,400
So, it's a protocol which was created in 88 and was used by geeks,

9
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,390
on the console, which has no extra features besides chatting in rooms and in private.

10
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,420
It is still used mainly by geeks, and is a bit endangered

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,980
because the mainstream is turned to instant messaging.

12
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,710
Multiple protocols were created after the 90s, the most known being MSN, ICQ

13
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,850
Facebook, and other kind of crap, which usually require proprietary clients

14
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,590
or similar, and have useless feature for the average bearded man

15
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,920
like webcam, file transfer (it's useless, we have mails, etc.).

16
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,160
So Minbif will allow you to fix this.

17
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,700
There already was a similar program, named BitlBee,

18
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,130
which is quite well-known, and originated the IRC to IM gateway.

19
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,940
From your IRC client, you would be able to communicate with non-geeks.

20
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,130
It's a fork of aim (gaim), a pretty crappy program.

21
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,450
Which was rewritten, well split, as it's now named pidgin, which you might know of.

22
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,580
They forked the code, and they maintained the protocols on their own,

23
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,940
as a result, no backports were possible, they support older versions of the protocols.

24
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,649
They had issues with MSN recently, or Yahoo, I don't remember.

25
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,150
Of course the code is pretty crappy.

26
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,400
So, as I said, pidgin split its application in parts:

27
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,849
pidgin, the GUI, and libpurple, which handles the abstraction of the protocols.

28
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,000
It handles more than 15 official protocols and also has unofficial plugins.

29
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,280
That's all I had to say.

30
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:12,060
So to start a project which goal was to have a more up-to-date and wider support of the protocols, it seemed to be a good idea.

31
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,620
Minbif was created a year ago from that idea, by using libpurple and being an abstraction to libpurple.

32
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,749
It is written in C++ and is now fairly stable, in its 1.0.3 version.

33
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,649
The idea is that the IRC client connects to Minbif, which is a fake IRC server,

34
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,980
which allows you to add accounts for instant messaging services

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,600
and it will be the gateway, translating everything to the IRC protocol,

36
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,249
allowing you to stay in your irssi to communicate with these aliens,

37
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,620
that are sometimes necessary for sex or this kind of stuff.

38
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,540
So, contacts are represented by IRC users, there are status channels, which start with an ampersand

39
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,410
which are supposed to be local channels on IRC.

40
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,549
We can see, considering their voice, if they are away or not.

41
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,049
If they are not in the channel they are not connected.

42
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,849
Unlike BitlBee, you use real IRC commands and do not type in the channel,

43
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,649
so /invite, /kick, /ban, /query, all that.

44
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,149
I don't really need to explain in detail,

45
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,700
I imagine you know IRC a bit, maybe.

46
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:36,160
It also handle discussion channels, like group chats in MSN, Jabber channels, this kind of stuff.

47
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,830
It's useful when you use jabber at your job.

48
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,750
Beside these the basic concepts, Minbif also has features BitlBee does not offer,

49
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,550
and that are *killer* features.

50
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,520
First, file transfers, to get any kind pictures.

51
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,750
It uses DCC, the protocol which is not really in the IRC standard,

52
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,320
but is over it, to transfer the files.

53
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,820
So, this is supported, it's cool.

54
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,020
After, the webcam is also handled over IRC.

55
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,480
As you might know, there are no streams other than text that are transmitted through IRC.

56
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:27,850
Hence we use DCC CHAT to transmit the stream, and an irssi plugin is necessary to display the webcam.

57
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,650
This gives roughly this, in short it uses libcaca for the textual representation,

58
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,820
since irssi is a console program.

59
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,990
So if you want to communicate via webcam with your niece or something like that

60
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,990
you can use the cacacam, which has a fairly impressive rendering.

61
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,940
Moreover, I don't know if you are users of linuxfr.org,

62
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,900
of the board, which is a bit hidden,

63
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,360
which is some sort of chat which uses the website and is not really like IRC.

64
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:22,170
While the access is through the website, there is a XML backend to get the messages and post responses,

65
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,590
so some clients were developed around it.

66
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,849
But for people who want to centralize their communications in irssi for instance,

67
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,050
a plugin was written for libpurple to do this.

68
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,800
You must no be able to see much, well, a bit still.

69
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,749
I don't know if you know the principle of the Linuxfr board,

70
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,260
where to respond we use the *norloges* (timestamps),

71
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,230
it's handled and puts the name of the stuff.

72
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,149
In short, it can enhance your unproductivity at work,

73
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,710
while staying hidden obviously, as it stays in irssi.

74
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,750
Globally, I have no idea what hour it is, but I'm almost finished.

75
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,510
In short, for the features…

76
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,750
(Excuse me? Yes? No? OK.)

77
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,560
So, for the future features, there is the handling of contacts,

78
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,249
which is in short when you have a Jabber and MSN account, and the same person on it, you can unite them in a single IRC user;

79
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,949
the handling of groups, and real webcam, where the idea would be

80
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,790
to have an irssi plugin to open a window with a non-libcaca rendering.

81
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,520
I think that's it.

82
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,960
Would you have questions, by chance?

83
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,750
Sorry? Do I fuck (nique)?

84
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,310
Oh, what's my nick? Sorry.

85
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,370
Is it a real question?

86
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,710
OK, that's cool.

87
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,749
So, are there real questions?

88
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,090
Yes?

89
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,660
OTR? What is it?

90
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,740
Oh, yes, indeed. But it's on the IRC client side.

91
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,320
It's not Minbif's job.

92
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,480
There are many aspects, of the GUI or similar, that are delegated to the IRC client

93
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,449
so Minbif does not have to do it.

94
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,249
Also, that's cool because Minbif does not have much to do since it is based on libpurple for the protocols

95
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,750
and the IRC client for the display.

96
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:59,250
It's a cool project because there is not much to do, but allows me to do conferences.

97
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,660
Another question? It would seem not.

98
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,380
Well, thanks.
