1
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:01,000
I will do a quick presentation of Minbif

2
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:02,000
which allows you to use IRC to communicate with the real world, the modern world

3
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:03,000
I don't know if there are many who know IRC, or don't know IRC maybe?

4
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:04,000
Considering the idleness of the room, I will… (shit)

5
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:05,000
I will (shit) be fairly short.

6
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:05,000
IRC is an ancient protocol which (fuck) was created in 88

7
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:06,000
which… (so, something is advancing automatically… now that's better)

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:07,000
So, it's a procotol which was created in 88 and was used by geeks

9
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:08,000
on the console, which has no extra features besides chatting in rooms and in private

10
00:01:05,350 --> 00:00:09,000
it is still used mainly by geeks, and is a bit endangered

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:00:10,000
because the mainstream is turned to instant messaging

12
00:01:19,450 --> 00:00:11,000
multiple protocols were created after the 90s, the most known being MSN, ICQ

13
00:01:24,750 --> 00:00:12,000
facebook, and other kind of crap, which usually require proprietary clients

14
00:01:32,150 --> 00:00:13,000
or similar, and have useless feature for the average bearded man

15
00:01:36,650 --> 00:00:14,000
like webcam, file transfer (it's useless, we have mails, etc.)

16
00:01:42,550 --> 00:00:15,000
so Minbif will allow you to fix this

17
00:01:51,250 --> 00:00:16,000
there already was a similar program, named BitlBee

18
00:01:54,750 --> 00:00:17,000
which is quite well-known, and originated the IRC to IM gateway

19
00:02:01,150 --> 00:00:18,000
from your IRC client, you would be able to communicate with non-geeks

20
00:02:06,050 --> 00:00:19,000
it's a fork of aim, a pretty crappy program

21
00:02:10,550 --> 00:00:20,000
which was rewritten, well splitted, as it's now named pidgin, which you might know of

22
00:02:19,850 --> 00:00:21,000
they forked the code, and they maintained the procotols on their own

23
00:02:25,150 --> 00:00:22,000
as a result, no backports were possible, the support older versions of the protocols

24
00:02:32,650 --> 00:00:23,000
they had issues with MSN recently, or Yahoo!, I don't remember

25
00:02:36,650 --> 00:00:24,000
of course the code is pretty crappy

26
00:02:40,550 --> 00:00:25,000
so, as I said, pidgin splitted its application in parts

27
00:02:44,950 --> 00:00:26,000
pidgin, the GUI, and libpurple, which handles the abstraction of the protocols

28
00:02:49,850 --> 00:00:27,000
it handles more than 15 official protocols and also has unofficcial plugins

29
00:02:58,550 --> 00:00:28,000
that's all I had to say

30
00:03:03,150 --> 00:00:29,000
so to start a project which goal was to have a more up-to-date and wider support of the protocols, it seemed to be a good idea

31
00:03:12,550 --> 00:00:30,000
Minbif was created a year ago from that idea, by using libpurple and being an abstraction to libpurple

32
00:03:26,550 --> 00:00:31,000
it is written in C++ and is now fairly stable, in its 1.0.3 version

33
00:03:29,750 --> 00:00:32,000
the idea is that the IRC client connects to Minbif, which is a fake IRC server

34
00:03:32,650 --> 00:00:33,000
which allows you to add accounts for instant messaging services

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:00:34,000
and it will be the gateway, translating everything to the IRC protocol

36
00:03:48,950 --> 00:00:35,000
allowing you to stay in your irssi to communicate with these aliens

37
00:03:53,250 --> 00:00:36,000
but that are sometimes necessary for sex or this kind of stuff

38
00:03:57,750 --> 00:00:37,000
so, contacts are represented by IRC users, there are status channels, which start with an ampersand

39
00:04:07,150 --> 00:00:38,000
which are supposed to be local channels in IRC

40
00:04:11,350 --> 00:00:39,000
we can see, considering their voice, if they are away or not

41
00:04:13,550 --> 00:00:40,000
if they are not in the channel they are not connected

42
00:04:16,050 --> 00:00:41,000
unlike BitlBee, you use real IRC commands and do not type in the channel

43
00:04:20,850 --> 00:00:42,000
so /invite, /kick, /ban, /query, all that

44
00:04:23,650 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't really need to explain in detail

45
00:04:26,150 --> 00:00:44,000
I imagine you know IRC a bit, maybe

46
00:04:29,550 --> 00:00:45,000
it also handle discussion channels, like group chats in msn, jabber channels, this kind of stuff

47
00:04:36,750 --> 00:00:46,000
it's useful when you use jabber at your job

48
00:04:42,250 --> 00:00:47,000
besides these the basic concepts, Minbif also has features BitlBee does not have

49
00:04:48,450 --> 00:00:48,000
and that are *killer* features

50
00:04:51,250 --> 00:00:49,000
first, file transfers, to get any kind pictures

51
00:04:57,150 --> 00:00:50,000
it uses DCC, the protocol which is not really in the IRC standard

52
00:05:03,650 --> 00:00:51,000
but is over it, to transfer the files

53
00:05:07,550 --> 00:00:52,000
so, this is supported, it's cool

54
00:05:11,050 --> 00:00:53,000
after, the webcam is also handled over IRC

55
00:05:14,350 --> 00:00:54,000
as you might know, there are no streams other than text that are transmitted through IRC

56
00:05:20,850 --> 00:00:55,000
hence we use DCC CHAT to transmit the stream, and an irssi plugin is necessary to display the webcam

57
00:05:31,150 --> 00:00:56,000
this gives roughly this, in short it uses libcaca for the textual representation

58
00:05:38,550 --> 00:00:57,000
since irssi is a console program

59
00:05:43,450 --> 00:00:58,000
so if you want to communicate via webcam with your niece or something like that

60
00:05:49,550 --> 00:00:59,000
you can use the cacacam, which has a fairly impressive rendering

61
00:05:56,150 --> 00:01:00,000
moreover, I don't know if you are users of linuxfr.org

62
00:06:02,350 --> 00:01:01,000
of the board, which is a bit hidden

63
00:06:04,950 --> 00:01:02,000
which is some sort of chat which uses the website and is not really like IRC

64
00:06:15,050 --> 00:01:03,000
while the access is through the website, there is a XML backend to get the messages and post responses

65
00:06:24,850 --> 00:01:04,000
so some clients were developed aroud it

66
00:06:29,650 --> 00:01:05,000
but for people who want to centralize their communications in irssi for instance

67
00:06:33,850 --> 00:01:06,000
a plugin was writtin for libpurple to do this

68
00:06:38,150 --> 00:01:07,000
you must no be able to see much, well, a bit still

69
00:06:43,750 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know if you know the principle of the Linuxfr board

70
00:06:46,750 --> 00:01:09,000
where to respond we use the *norloges* (timestamps)

71
00:06:51,150 --> 00:01:10,000
it's handled and puts the name of the stuff

72
00:06:54,550 --> 00:01:11,000
in short, it can enhance your improductivity at work

73
00:06:58,150 --> 00:01:12,000
while staying hidden obviously as it stays in irssi

74
00:07:05,150 --> 00:01:13,000
globally, I have no idea what hour it is, but I'm almost finished

75
00:07:10,650 --> 00:01:14,000
in short, for the features

76
00:07:18,950 --> 00:01:15,000
(excuse me? yes? no? ok.)

77
00:07:24,650 --> 00:01:16,000
so, for the future features, is the handling of contacts

78
00:07:29,750 --> 00:01:17,000
which is in short when you have a jabber and msn account, and the same person on it, you can unite them in a single IRC user

79
00:07:36,250 --> 00:01:18,000
the handling of groups, and real webcam, where the idea would be

80
00:07:39,950 --> 00:01:19,000
to have an irssi plugin to open a window with a non-libcaca rendering

81
00:07:48,250 --> 00:01:20,000
I think that's it

82
00:07:50,450 --> 00:01:21,000
Would you have questions, by chance?

83
00:07:53,950 --> 00:01:22,000
Sorry? Do I fuck (nique)?

84
00:07:57,450 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, what's my nick? Sorry.

85
00:08:10,750 --> 00:01:24,000
Is it a real question?

86
00:08:15,550 --> 00:01:25,000
OK, that's cool.

87
00:08:20,150 --> 00:01:26,000
So, are there real questions?

88
00:08:21,750 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes?

89
00:08:24,450 --> 00:01:28,000
OTR? What is it?

90
00:08:31,250 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, yes, indeed. But it's on the IRC client side.

91
00:08:36,750 --> 00:01:30,000
It's not Minbif's job.

92
00:08:38,650 --> 00:01:31,000
There are many aspects, of the GUI or similar, that are delegated to the IRC client

93
00:08:44,550 --> 00:01:32,000
so Minbif does not have to do it.

94
00:08:46,450 --> 00:01:33,000
Also, that's cool because Minbif does not have much to do since it is based on libpurple for the protocols

95
00:08:50,250 --> 00:01:34,000
and the IRC client for the display.

96
00:08:53,250 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a cool project because there is not much to do, but allows me to do conferences.

97
00:09:01,150 --> 00:01:36,000
Another question? It would seem not.

98
00:09:06,450 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, thanks.
